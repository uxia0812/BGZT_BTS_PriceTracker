One Tree Planted is a global organization that works with communities and experts to create environmental impact via reforestation. And that’s just the beginning! Read more about ‘One Tree Planted’ [here](https://onetreeplanted.org/) here!\n\nWe chose ‘One Tree Planted’ to connect with our [Purple Planet Project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/1q4ovpc/rbangtan_purple_planet_project_sustainably/) as a way to be more aware of the waste created during a k-pop comeback and tour and the ways we can offset some of that waste. The goal is to reduce our carbon footprint in a smart, realistic, and enjoyable way.\n\nOur fundraising goal is $7,000; however, we know belts are tight right now so we’re not going to focus too heavily on meeting it. Please give what you can!\n\n# [DONATE VIA TILTIFY HERE](https://tilt.fyi/vAMThjyBtV)\n\n***\n\nIf you are unable to donate at this time, please consider downloading and sharing one of [these graphics](https://postimg.cc/gallery/YvGcZ9F) (created by the lovely u/Eternal_ARMY0613) on all your socials!
